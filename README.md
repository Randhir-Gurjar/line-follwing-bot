# Line-follwing-Bot

## *About* 
This is a basic Ardiuno project. In this I have used IR sensors to move the bot on the line in this case black line I have used digital inputs you can try with analog inputs and try to move it on different colors. 

### *Working*
Its working is based on the sensor's reading when the IR sensor both the left and right 0 the the bot will move forward, when both sensors will give 1 the bot wil stop, 0 1 and 1 0 for left and right turns this will intend the bot to move on the line accurately. On the basis of the raeadings, I have programmed the motors.
